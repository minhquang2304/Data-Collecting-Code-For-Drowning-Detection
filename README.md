# This is the data sender code for Machine Learning drowning model

The software is meant to be run on a ESP32 with an accelerometer

The ESP32 (Sender) will send data to another ESP32 (Receiver) using ESPNow protocol  
The receiver then feed data to a computer in real time for data collection and storing.

This software is dedicated to collecting data for training model on drowning detection on people and meant to be run before the actual implementation of the Machine Learning model
